# odin-recipes
This is a recipe site where you can find several recipes for my favourite foods. It is not very broad and aesthetic since this is my very first html project.
This first odin html project helps me put in practice everything i have learnt so far. This includes: how to use the virtual machine, how to use the cli, how to use git, and last but not least, how to use several tags in html, like h1, p, img, a etc.
